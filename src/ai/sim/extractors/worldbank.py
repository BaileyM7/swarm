"""World Bank signal extractor.

World Bank indicator releases are slow-moving (annual / quarterly).  On a
24-hour window the typical case is "no signal."  We surface a signal only
when a recently-ingested indicator row materially shifts an indicator we
care about (GDP growth, current account balance) for the requested
country.

This extractor intentionally returns None most turns.  That's the whole
point of the elegance design: silence is the default.
